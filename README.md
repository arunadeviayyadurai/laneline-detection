# LaneLine-Detection
Lane line detection using Python and OpenCV captures images from a car-mounted camera 📸, converts them to grayscale, and applies Gaussian blur 🌫️. Canny edge detection identifies edges, while the Hough Transform detects and extrapolates lane lines 🛣️. This real-time method enhances driving safety 🚗.
